        In a unanimous vote Tuesday evening, the Atlanta City Council approved a
        comprehensive $2.3 billion infrastructure package that promises to
        reshape downtown Atlanta over the next decade. The ambitious plan
        addresses long-standing concerns about transportation, affordable
        housing, and green space accessibility in the city&apos;s core.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
        &quot;This is a transformative moment for our city,&quot; said Council
        President Doug Shipman during the meeting. &quot;We&apos;re not just
        fixing what&apos;s broken – we&apos;re building the foundation for
        Atlanta&apos;s next chapter of growth and prosperity.&quot;
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
        The package includes $800 million for transit improvements, including
        expanded MARTA connectivity and dedicated bus rapid transit lanes.
        Another $600 million will fund affordable housing initiatives, with a
        goal of creating 5,000 new units within walking distance of major
        employment centers.

          Key Investment Areas:
        </h3>
        <ul className="space-y-2 text-gray-700">
          <li>• $800M for transit and transportation improvements</li>
          <li>• $600M for affordable housing development</li>
          <li>• $500M for green infrastructure and parks</li>
          <li>• $400M for utility modernization and broadband expansion</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
        Environmental sustainability features prominently in the plan, with $500
        million allocated for green infrastructure projects. This includes the
        creation of three new downtown parks, expanded tree canopy coverage, and
        implementation of sustainable stormwater management systems.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
        The remaining $400 million will modernize the city&apos;s utility
        infrastructure and expand high-speed broadband access to underserved
        neighborhoods, addressing digital equity concerns that became more
        apparent during the pandemic.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
        Funding for the initiative will come from a combination of federal
        infrastructure grants, municipal bonds, and public-private partnerships.
        City officials expect construction to begin in early 2025, with the
        first phase of projects completed by 2027.
